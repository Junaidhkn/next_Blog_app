Express.js and GraphQL are both popular tools for building APIs (Application
Programming Interfaces) that allow clients to access and manipulate data stored
on a server. While both can be used to build APIs, they have some key
differences that you should understand before deciding which one to use for your
project.

One of the main differences between Express.js and GraphQL is the way that they
handle data requests. Express.js is a web application framework that uses a
traditional REST (Representational State Transfer) API architecture. This means
that clients send HTTP requests to specific endpoints, and the server responds
with the requested data.

For example, if you wanted to retrieve a list of users from an Express.js API,
you might send a GET request to an endpoint such as /api/users, and the server
would respond with a list of users in the form of a JSON object.

Here's an example of how you might set up an endpoint for retrieving a list of
users using Express.js:

```js
const express = require('express');

const app = express();

app.get('/api/users', (req, res) => {
	// Retrieve list of users from the database

	const users = [
		{ id: 1, name: 'John' },
		{ id: 2, name: 'Jane' },
	];

	res.json(users);
});
```

On the other hand, GraphQL is a query language that allows clients to request
specific pieces of data from a server in a flexible and customizable way. With
GraphQL, clients can specify exactly what data they want to retrieve, and the
server will respond with only the requested data, rather than a fixed set of
data like in a REST API.

For example, if you wanted to retrieve a list of users using a GraphQL API, you
might send a query that looks like this:

```js
{ users { id name } }

The server would then respond with a JSON object that contains only the requested data, like this:

{ "data":

{ "users": [ { "id": 1, "name": "John" },

{ "id": 2, "name":"Jane" } ]

 } }
```

Another difference between Express.js and GraphQL is the way that they handle
data updates. With an Express.js REST API, you would typically use different
HTTP methods (such as POST, PUT, and DELETE) to create, update, and delete
records. With GraphQL, you can use the same query syntax to perform all of these
operations, and you can specify exactly which fields you want to update or
delete.

Here's an example of how you might use GraphQL to update a user record:

```js

mutation { updateUser(id: 1, name: "Bob") { id name } }

The server would then respond with a JSON object that contains the updated user data:

{ "data": { "updateUser": { "id": 1, "name": "Bob" } } }

```

In summary, Express.js and GraphQL are both useful tools for building APIs, but
they have some key differences that you should consider when deciding which one
to use for your project. REST API using Express.js A REST API is a type of API
that follows a set of architectural principles for building web services. One of
the most popular frameworks for building REST APIs is Express.js, a minimalist
web framework for Node.js.

In a REST API built with Express.js, you define endpoints (URLs) for each
resource you want to expose. For example, if you want to create a REST API for a
list of books, you might define the following endpoints:

GET /books:

Returns a list of all books

GET /books/:id: Returns the book with the specified ID

POST /books: Creates a new book

PUT /books/:id: Updates the book with the specified ID

DELETE /books/:id: Deletes the book with the specified ID Here is an example of
how you might implement a GET /books endpoint using Express.js:

```js
const express = require('express');

const router = express.Router();

// An in-memory database of books

const books = [
	{ id: 1, title: 'The Alchemist', author: 'Paulo Coelho' },

	{ id: 2, title: 'The Great Gatsby', author: 'F. Scott Fitzgerald' },

	{ id: 3, title: 'To Kill a Mockingbird', author: 'Harper Lee' },
];

// GET /books

router.get('/', (req, res) => {
	res.json(books);
});

module.exports = router;
```

GraphQL API GraphQL is a query language for your API that allows clients to
request exactly the data they need, and nothing more. It was developed by
Facebook as an alternative to REST APIs, which often return a fixed set of data
for each endpoint regardless of the needs of the client.

In a GraphQL API, you define a schema that describes the types of data available
and the relationships between them. For example, the schema for the books API
might look like this:

```js
 type Book { id: ID! title: String! author: String! }

type Query { books: [Book!]! book(id: ID!): Book }

type Mutation {
   createBook(title: String!, author: String!): Book!

updateBook(id: ID!, title: String, author: String):

Book deleteBook(id: ID!):
Book }
```

To query the API, clients send a GraphQL request with a query or mutation
string. For example, to get a list of all books, the client might send the
following request:

```js
query { books { id title author } }
```

The server responds with the requested data in JSON format:

```js
{ "data": { "books": [ { "id": "1", "title": "The Alchemist",
"author": "Paulo Coelho" }, { "id": "2", "title": "The Great Gatsby", "author":
"F. Scott Fitzgerald" },
```
